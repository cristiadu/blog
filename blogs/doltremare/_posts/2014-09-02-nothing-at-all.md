Between my feelings, and the distance between us

There is this certain, the bright side of you and me still exist

And did not fade even slightly

My smile while seeing you on a electronic block of communication

It is real, it is a smile of someone hoping to feel warm again.

Hoping to see you.

While writing is becoming difficult

While staying alone all the time makes me feel the emptiness on my life

You, my small little girl, makes me want to learn.

Learn how to survive feeling good about myself.

Learn how to live without you, and then be stronger with your heart on my side.

Then, when I feel sleepy, and want you in my bed with me.

I can feel your heart, and live alone would not sound so hard anymore.

I will tell the truth.

You are 90% of the reason of my life right now.

And the lonelier that I get, the bigger your part on my life become.

I want us to become one.

I want me to stay happy

To get closer to the perfection that I could be.

But while I wrote this, all I could think was:

"How hard writing could be for an ex writer?".

And felt sad for losing the ability to speak with my fingers.

To put words on my mind.

I know how I feel, I know what I want, I know what you want.

I just do not know how to get on the point

That I do not need anything at all

To make a smile, to love the man I am.

I just hope that you still love that

The confusing life that you will get with me.

I just hope that I can find myself

Before you get sick of me trying.
