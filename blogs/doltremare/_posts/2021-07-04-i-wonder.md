What if I wished really stronglythat this small piece of wondercould transform into something more?What if I was afraidthat I’m rushing ideas,that my dreams are just fearsand I will be alone again?
What if I felt this is unfair,that she should be aware,but not enforced into accepting it?What if she has her own dreamsbarely involving me,and here am I, creating this whole sceneas if I’m the director.
What if I’m just scaredof being unaware, of being unprepared.What if this is just me sabotaging myself again?I wonder if this dream can even exist,or is just an illusion againto tell me all is betterwhen it ain’t.
Passion is out of my dictionary,but here am I wondering,as if it can just be created,as if I can just feel it.As if she would feel it too.
What if it all works well,with me one day grinningfrom side to side,reading this to another smile,while I stroke her hair?What if she is unaware,but not unwilling to be therefor this deluded dream of mine?
Should I phase this out as just an illusion,or should I dream knowing it can happen?Should I stop of hopefully write,or hope the written words will take life... and fly?
