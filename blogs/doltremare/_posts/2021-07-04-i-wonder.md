<p>What if I wished really strongly</p><p>that this small piece of wonder</p><p>could transform into something more?</p><p>What if I was afraid</p><p>that I’m rushing ideas,</p><p>that my dreams are just fears</p><p>and I will be alone again?</p><p>

</p><p>What if I felt this is unfair,</p><p>that she should be aware,</p><p>but not enforced into accepting it?</p><p>What if she has her own dreams</p><p>barely involving me,</p><p>and here am I, creating this whole scene</p><p>as if I’m the director.</p><p>

</p><p>What if I’m just scared</p><p>of being unaware, of being unprepared.</p><p>What if this is just me sabotaging myself again?</p><p>I wonder if this dream can even exist,</p><p>or is just an illusion again</p><p>to tell me all is better</p><p>when it ain’t.</p><p>

</p><p>Passion is out of my dictionary,</p><p>but here am I wondering,</p><p>as if it can just be created,</p><p>as if I can just feel it.</p><p>As if she would feel it too.</p><p>

</p><p>What if it all works well,</p><p>with me one day grinning</p><p>from side to side,</p><p>reading this to another smile,</p><p>while I stroke her hair?</p><p>What if she is unaware,</p><p>but not unwilling to be there</p><p>for this deluded dream of mine?</p><p>

</p><p>Should I phase this out as just an illusion,</p><p>or should I dream knowing it can happen?</p><p>Should I stop of hopefully write,</p><p>or hope the written words will take life</p><p>... and fly?</p>
