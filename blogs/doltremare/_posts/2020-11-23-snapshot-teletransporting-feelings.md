<p>He wakes up, looks ahead while slowly opening his child eyes.</p><p>He slept in the couch again. It's 9:30pm.</p><p>"Oh, I guess it's still not time", said to himself, while having headaches due to oversleeping on boredom.</p><p>The soap opera starts again, it's the third of the night, and he is following all of them.</p><p>He immerses in the world of the TV again, sitting in the corner of the sofa, with the curtains closed due to the darkness outside. He is way too close to the TV.</p><p>And the travel begins.</p><p>- I'm here for you, Jessica. "Oh wait, he's not supposed to say this, it's betrayal".

- So you mean you forgot Melissa completely? "No he did not! I mean, cmon, that barely makes sense!".</p><p>He is getting mad, screaming at the TV.</p><p>- Yes, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She is gone for good. "What do you mean she is gone for good?".

- What do you mean she is gone for good? "Yes..."

- I killed her. "Oh no, fuck this shit".</p><p>He shuts off the TV.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He experiences the silence while pressing his hands shut as strong as he can do. He is angry, way too angry for something so silly as a plot from a TV show.</p><p>He stops. Silence again. He starts crying. He doesn't know why.</p><p>"It's so stupid" - he says while tears were still coming out of his eyes. "Why do I care about this so much? It's just a dumb TV show". His 11th years old mind thinks loudly to himself.</p><p>Runs to the bathroom, water to eyes, look in the mirror. "Your sad ugly face". Towel.</p><p>Calm. Silence again. Way more silence than ever before.</p><p>"Why am I like this?".</p><p>No one answers. He looks in the clock, still 10pm.Â </p><p>"One more hour and they will be here."</p><p>Turns on the TV.</p><p>Endscene.</p>
