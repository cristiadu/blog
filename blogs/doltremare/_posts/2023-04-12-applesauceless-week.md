Lately the nights have an added sparkle,
like you could, with your smile,
just brighten a whole townhouse.
Clean energy for everyone around you.


Lately I've been dreaming more,
smiling more, laughing more,
existing more, being more.
Believing more that the future carries good things.


I think I can put you to a fault;
blame you, scold you, hold you in court.
You; the one that makes me feel again
right when I thought it was all in vain.


If this is a confession of love right here,
I need to show how much the poet in me
misses what has been his inspiration so far.
Yes, I miss you, and it has been only one week.


I just want to enjoy every moment
of my weakness in fallingÂ 
over, and over again,
strongly, what a shame,
for you.
