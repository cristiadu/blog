<p>Lately the nights have an added sparkle,</p><p>like you could, with your smile,</p><p>just brighten a whole townhouse.</p><p>Clean energy for everyone around you.</p><p>

</p><p>Lately I've been dreaming more,</p><p>smiling more, laughing more,</p><p>existing more, being more.</p><p>Believing more that the future carries good things.</p><p>

</p><p>I think I can put you to a fault;</p><p>blame you, scold you, hold you in court.</p><p>You; the one that makes me feel again</p><p>right when I thought it was all in vain.</p><p>

</p><p>If this is a confession of love right here,</p><p>I need to show how much the poet in me</p><p>misses what has been his inspiration so far.</p><p>Yes, I miss you, and it has been only one week.</p><p>

</p><p>I just want to enjoy every moment</p><p>of my weakness in fallingÂ </p><p>over, and over again,</p><p>strongly, what a shame,</p><p>for you.</p><p>
