<p style="text-align: center;">Words cannot describe how this is happening in my head.</p><p style="text-align: center;">How the silence of the voice doesn't tell how crowded the mind is.</p><p style="text-align: center;">If the mind can even be called a single entity,</p><p style="text-align: center;">as it just fights within itself breaking each part, each certainty;</p><p style="text-align: center;">Each try giving up later,</p><p style="text-align: center;">each moment I have to pick the broken glasses of my head,</p><p style="text-align: center;">and remount myself again.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Like connected Legos that don't create any form.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Here I go again, here goes the call to move.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Even though the wind is just as confused;</p><p style="text-align: center;">even though the thoughts can't be even sure of themselves.</p><p style="text-align: center;">"Am I invented", "Am I a delusion"?</p><p style="text-align: center;">So much self-hatred is mixed up with sugar.</p><p style="text-align: center;">"I will get better if I die a little bit more on the inside"</p><p style="text-align: center;">"I will get worse if I try because giving up is inevitable"</p><p style="text-align: center;">Good and bad, </p><p style="text-align: center;">or at least the conception of what they mean, </p><p style="text-align: center;">get just mixed up with dreamy realities </p><p style="text-align: center;">that never happened, and never will.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Or will they?</p><p style="text-align: center;">They won't. They will. They won't.</p><p style="text-align: center;">A lemon spritzed with the brain in between.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Everyday he dies a bit more from within.</p><p style="text-align: center;">And I feel lost, </p><p style="text-align: center;">my rationale cannot do the math:</p><p style="text-align: center;">How can I improve such debacle?</p><p style="text-align: center;">When I can't trust him, even with him being myself.</p><p style="text-align: center;">I can't trust me, even with me being himself.</p><p style="text-align: center;">This green piece doesn't fit with the orange one.</p><p style="text-align: center;">We bought the wrong set at birth.</p><p style="text-align: center;">And I get hurt.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes think I will never be worth.</p><p style="text-align: center;">So the guess is that things will just move.</p><p style="text-align: center;">I will just move, he will move too.</p><p style="text-align: center;">But what is the point of moving guideless?</p><p style="text-align: center;">Where is the joy when you can't agree with yourself?

</p><p style="text-align: center;">I just honestly wish...</p><p style="text-align: center;">I was someone else.</p><p style="text-align: center;">
