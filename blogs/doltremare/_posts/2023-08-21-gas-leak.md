Tssss
tssss
tss...
it's building up.
It always builds up.
It's just always there.
Like heat building up from the oven.
Like a valve, a geiser.
It almost feels surreal,
not real
you're not even there.
But you know where you are,
don't you? You do.
But
you feel you don't have a map,
you feel the gps has no signal.
Tssss
tsss
tss...
the valve keeps reminding;
the lack of choices,
the lack of movement
the lack of peace;
Everywhere, everyday
the mind floats nowhere,
trying to look everywhere
for an way out of this shallow grave,
a way out of the sounds
Tssss
tsss
tss..
they are just there
all the time
why?
You think, with your now confused undertones
"I'm just a collection of meat and bones,
why can't I just convince myself
this is just life and nothing else?
The noise will fade
if you stop listening to the valve so much"
Tssss
tsss
tss..
But it is just so loud
being lost on a suffocating crowd
of no one but multiple yourselfs.
You feel like you're nobody else.
It's just you with these sounds
until your mind finally melts.
