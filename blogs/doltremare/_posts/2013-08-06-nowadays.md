When you talked to me,

like a little angel talk to a sinner,

I realized that something poked me

right on the thing I should call my heart,

but I will not.

Because, before I have meeting you,

the 'nothing' stopped and stared me for so long

and my heart was so gone, that did not exist.

My brain was so focused on something else

that I almost let you escape from my arms,

almost let me without touching those beautiful lips.



When I kissed you

I forgot about everything else on that morning

and on that dawn, and on that evening.

We all should be sleeping,

but I can not go to sleep

when those eyes are looking at me.

That kissing moment

I realized that I had taken back my feelings

and they punched me, right on the heart,

just to it back to the beat he had before.



When I asked you to be my wife

the world stopped for ten slow seconds.

Your friends, the angels from heaven,

picked up me and raised me, like if in that moment

I had become sort of an angel too.

I raised to heaven with you

and all those other people stayed staring,

asking yourself "why does it not happens with me?".

It does, when you find your priceless angel.
