Art is strict;
It is hands and pens finding their purpose.
It is brushes and pieces dancing in synchrony.
You have to find the rhyme, you have to find the rhythm.
Put your clothes off and strike that pose.

Art is structure
Inspiration, melancholy, ABAB.
It's a fine conversation between you and me
All those terms there was never an use for
Lyrical poem here, just use it more.

Art is suffocating
Should be freeing, however, it is not.
Should be seen, but the writer wants to hide.
The painter wants to forget about the climb.
The artisan to forget about his knots.

Art is searching
Looking into papers for any meaning
Drawing your own reality into a canvas
Antagonizing the rules of reality
Creating the world we were all dreaming
Bright colorful lights that enchant us
But we never find the answer, sadly.

Art is seeing,
Art is swimming,
Art is shield,
Art is sword
Art is hearing your words
on a Sunday afternoon.
