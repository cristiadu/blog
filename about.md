Hi, my name is Cristiano (:

Professionally speaking, that's my description:
```
I have, 31 years old, born in Brazil, and currently living in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Highly passionate professional who thrives on working with challenges using technology, particularly through lines of code and logical reasoning. 

With proficiency in Fullstack Web Development, Quality Assurance, and Software Architecture, backed by over 10 years of experience, I possess a strong foundation in these areas.

I am always open to learning new technologies and embracing new challenges. 

Currently, I am seeking a challenging software engineering role where I can leverage my skills and drive the development of innovative solutions.
```

A bit more personally speaking; I'm a guy that loves coding, technology and learning new things. I also love observing people being very passionate about what they love, as I strive to keep that flame burning on my career each day (so far it is working!).

I also love writing, and been trying to go back into more creative ways the last few years; working too much definitely made me lose my art touch.

Hopefully soon I will be able to increase this description, as we're never that great at describing ourselves to people.
